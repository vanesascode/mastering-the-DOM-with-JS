# Mastering the DOM with JavaScript

My notes learning in depth the DOM and the interaction with it using JS.

### ðŸŸ  What is the DOM?

The DOM stands for `Document Object Model`. It is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents.

The DOM represents the `structure of a document` as a tree-like structure, where each node represents a part of the document (such as an element, attribute, or text).

It allows programs to `dynamically access and manipulate` the content, structure, and style of a document.

### ðŸŸ  Every HTML element has an object in the document hierarchy:

When an HTML document is parsed (is analyzed) by a web browser, it creates a representation of the document as a `DOM tree`. This tree consists of various nodes, with each node representing an HTML element.

Every element in the markup represents a `node` in the Document Object Model (DOM) hierarchy.

Each node in the DOM tree corresponds to `an HTML element, attribute, or text` within the HTML document.

The nodes are organized in a hierarchical structure, where each node has a parent node (except for the root node) and can have zero or more child nodes.

### ðŸŸ  Interacting with the DOM:

The DOM hierarchy allows you to access and manipulate the elements in an HTML document using `JavaScript`.

Each node in the DOM has `properties and methods` that can be used to interact with it, such as changing its content, modifying its attributes, adding or removing child nodes, and more.
